\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Please report your design, implementation details, findings of the first project in this report. \\
    You can add references if necessary \cite{article}. \\
    THE REPORT SHOULD NOT EXCEED 3 PAGES.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Give a brief introduction about the aim of the project, and your road-map about the design/implementation.
\section{Part I}

\subsection{Threat model}
Give the corresponding threat model for the first part of the project that you implemented. 
\subsection{Implementation details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Give your implementation details
    \item Detail the circuit you created at the end of the first part
\end{itemize}
\section{Part II}
\subsection{Threat model}
Give the corresponding threat model for the second part of the project that you implemented. 
\subsection{Implementation details}
Give implementation details.
\section{Evaluation}
- Give a comprehensive comparison and evaluation about Part1 and Part2 of the project including performance results. Feel free to use charts, tables, plots...\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item What affects the efficiency of the executions? Be specific, which types of operations/circuits are directly linked to performance?
    \item Is there any difference in terms of performance between Part I and Part II? Why? 
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Comment on your findings, discuss different outcomes for each part.
    \item Discuss outcomes from different circuits including your own circuit.
    \item In your opinion, which model is appropriate to use under which conditions/threat model? Why? Discuss.
    \item Come up with a scenario for each part of the implementation, discuss why it makes sense to use homomorphic encryption based generation of Beaver triplets.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assess your learning outcomes for this project.
    \item What did you do? What did you learn? Any interesting design ideas? 
\end{itemize}
